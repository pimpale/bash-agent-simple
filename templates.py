YOUR TASK:
Find out how many days have passed since April 2nd 2019. Return just the number of days as an integer.

**ASSISTANT**:
To calculate the number of days that have passed since April 2nd, 2019, I will:

1. Get the current date.
2. Calculate the difference between the current date and April 2nd, 2019.
3. Return the result as an integer.

Let's start with getting the current date.

<bash>date +%F</bash>

**USER**:
BASH OUTPUT:
2024-07-25

**ASSISTANT**:
The current date is July 25th, 2024. Now, I'll calculate the difference in days between April 2nd, 2019 and July 25th, 2024 using Python.

Here is the step-by-step plan:
1. Define the start date (April 2nd, 2019).
2. Define the end date (July 25th, 2024).
3. Calculate the difference in days between the two dates.
4. Print the result.

Let's execute the Python code.

<bash>python3 -c "
from datetime import datetime

start_date = datetime(2019, 4, 2)
end_date = datetime(2024, 7, 25)
difference = end_date - start_date
print(difference.days)
"</bash>

**USER**:
BASH OUTPUT:
1941

**ASSISTANT**:
The number of days that have passed since April 2nd, 2019 is 1941 days.
<submit>1941</submit>
